### WebAPI using ASP .NET Core
> Client centric vs Server centric websites
> 
> Content creation done at client side vs at server side.

* Service Oriented Architechture (SOA) - to make our program logic *reachable* (usable by any platform, any architechture).
* Communication is neutralised by setting some standards for all.
* Provides platform independent *RPC* (Remote procedural call), known as *Messaging Architechture* in SOA.
* Two verticals
  * SOAP based.
  * REST based (Primary focus).
* *Publish* a *business logic* to be reacable by everyone.

* Important components of SOA -
  * Message
  * Transport (To transfer the messages)
  * Representation of Payload (arguments and results).

### REST Style
* Transport protocol - HTTP
* Communication protocol (Message structure) - HTTP
  * Arguments - Either using query string, URL segment or http-body.
  * Operation identity (Which method to be called) - URL + http verb
  * Exceptions - HTTP status codes
